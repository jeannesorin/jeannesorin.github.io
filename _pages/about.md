Welcome to my website!

I am a rising 5th year PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. I am also a DRW PhD Fellow at [EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/). 

My research interests are at the intersection of environmental, development, history and urban/spatial economics.

I previously graduated with a MSc in Economics, and a BA in Social Sciences from SciencesPo Paris. 

You can download my cv [here](/assets/pdf/cv_jeanne.pdf).
