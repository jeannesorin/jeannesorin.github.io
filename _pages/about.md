Welcome! 
I am an economist doing research at the intersection of development economics, urban / spatial economics and environmental economics.


In July 2026 I will join UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy as an Assistant Professor, after a one year postdoc at [the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth at the University of Chicago](https://climate.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/).

I study the challenges faced by developing cities, focusing on transportation infrastructure and environmental hazards. To that end, I use quantitative spatial models, novel survey data and randomized control trials in order to answer policy-relevant questions. My current projects span Uganda, Indonesia, India and (historical) France.
