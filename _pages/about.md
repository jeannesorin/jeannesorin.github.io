Welcome! I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. I study challenges to sustainable urban growth in developing countries, with a focus on transportation infrastructure, air pollution and their interaction. My current projects span Uganda, Indonesia and (historical) France.

<span style="color: blue;">**I will be on the 2024-2025 Academic Job Market**.</span>

I previously graduated with a MSc in Economics and a BA in Social Sciences from SciencesPo Paris. I am also a DRW PhD Fellow at [EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/).

You can download my CV [here](/assets/pdf/Jeanne_Sorin_CV.pdf).
