Welcome to my website!

I am a rising third year PhD student in Economics at the University of Chicago. 
I am also a DRW PhD Fellow at [EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/).

My research interests are at the intersection of environmental, development, history and urban/spatial economics.

I previously graduated with a MSc in Economics, and a BA in Social Sciences from Sciences Paris. In my free time I read history books, I swim in the lake and I play the Flute.

You can download my cv [here](/assets/pdf/cv_jeanne.pdf).
