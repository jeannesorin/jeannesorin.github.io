Welcome! 
I am an applied microeconomist doing research at the intersection of development economics, urban / spatial economics and environmental economics.

In July 2026 I will join UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy as an Assistant Professor, after a one year postdoc at the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth at the University of Chicago.

In my [Job Market Paper](/assets/pdf/Sorin_JMP.pdf), I examine how land acquisition threatens the net returns of road improvements in Kampala, Uganda.

More broadly, I study the challenges faced by developing cities, focusing on transportation infrastructure and environmental hazards. To that end, I use quantitative spatial models, novel survey data and randomized control trials in order to answer policy-relevant questions. My current projects span Uganda, Indonesia, India and (historical) France.


I am also a DRW PhD Fellow at [EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/).

You can download my CV [here](/assets/pdf/Jeanne_Sorin_CV.pdf).
