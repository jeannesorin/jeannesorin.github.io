Welcome! 
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. My primary research fields are development economics, urban / spatial economics and environmental economics.

I was on the 2024-2025 Academic Job Market. I will join UC Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy as an Assistant Professor in July 2026, after a one year postdoc.

In my [Job Market Paper](/assets/pdf/Sorin_JMP.pdf), I examine how land acquisition threatens the net returns of road improvements in Kampala, Uganda.

More broadly, I study the challenges faced by developing cities, focusing on transportation infrastructure and environmental hazards. To that end, I use quantitative spatial models, novel survey data and randomized control trials in order to answer policy-relevant questions. My current projects span Uganda, Indonesia, India and (historical) France.


I am also a DRW PhD Fellow at [EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/).
