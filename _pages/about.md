Welcome! 
I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at the University of Chicago. I study challenges to sustainable urban growth in developing countries, with a focus on transportation infrastructure, air pollution and their interaction. My current projects span Uganda, Indonesia, and (historical) France.

In my job market paper,  I examine how land acquisition threatens the net returns of road improvements in Kampala, Uganda.

<span style="color: blue;">**I am on the 2024-2025 Academic Job Market**.</span>

I am also a DRW PhD Fellow at [EPIC](https://epic.uchicago.edu/people/jeanne-sorin/).
