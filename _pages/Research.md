    Despite the enormous costs of air pollution, willingness-to-pay (WTP) for clean air in polluted developing contexts remains low. We posit one understudied reason is that clean air is an experience good, whose value is revealed after consumption. We test this using a cluster-randomized trial, and seek to document an “experience wedge”, i.e. a difference between anticipated and realized utility of consuming a good. We deploy a novel experience-based intervention, installing air monitors and purifiers, potentially a more salient treatment than traditional information in pamphlets or videos. To explore the mechanisms behind the hypothesized wedge, we implement a purifier-only treatment to distinguish between (1) knowledge about objective pollution exposure and (2) the sensory experience of breathing in clean air. This will be the first experimental evidence demonstrating how experience can shift demand for clean air, with implications for public health policy, environmental awareness campaigns, and using WTP estimates in economic evaluations.

    Air pollution within African cities is high but unevenly distributed. In principle, individuals could mitigate the severe health risk by working in the less polluted parts of the city. In practice, we show that pollution avoidance is challenging because firms locate on the busiest and most polluted roads searching for customer visibility. Both workers and entrepreneurs bear the cost of this pollution exposure, but the benefits are unequally distributed: profits are much higher in polluted areas, while compensating differentials in wages are minimal. An information experiment reveals limited awareness of pollution, suggesting that workers might be undercompensated for their exposure.

    This study investigates the relationship between outdoor and indoor air pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia, one of the largest cities in the world. Using data from over 300 indoor and outdoor pollution monitors over a three-month period, we explore the temporal and spatial relationship between outdoor and indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Our key findings reveal that penetration rates of outdoor pollution into indoor spaces are significantly higher than those documented in previous studies conducted in developed settings. We quantify the proportion of indoor air pollution attributable to outdoor sources versus indoor sources, providing insights into the primary drivers of indoor air quality. Through extensive surveying, we also explore factors contributing to heterogeneity in the outdoor-indoor pollution relationship, including housing structure, demographic variables, and household behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both outdoor and indoor air quality in comprehensive pollution mitigation strategies.
