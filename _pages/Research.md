#### [Public Roads on Private Lands: Land Costs and Optimal Road Improvements in Urban Uganda (JMP)](/assets/pdf/Sorin_JMP.pdf)

    High land acquisition costs often undermine the net returns and hinder the implementation of high benefit infrastructure projects in developing cities. I examine this issue in Kampala, Uganda, using new survey data on real-estate brokers and landowners to evaluate the costs and benefits of 140 km of road improvements implemented since 2017. Leveraging the timing of improvements, I estimate their local benefits, and I develop a quantitative spatial model to account for the general equilibrium gains, including spillovers and the fiscal cost of land acquisition. Weak property rights enable the government to acquire land at reduced cost, acting as a subsidy to the government. Combined with a high cost of raising domestic funds, these weak property rights support more extensive road improvements with city-wide benefits. In turn, the realized road improvements yield net welfare gains equivalent to 99 USD per Kampala resident, compared to 40 USD if land had been acquired at market value, as legally mandated under eminent domain. Finally, I solve for the optimal road improvements under different institutional settings and funding restrictions, offering insights for policy design to enhance allocative efficiency and welfare outcomes.

    Despite the enormous costs of air pollution, willingness-to-pay (WTP) for clean air in polluted developing contexts remains low. We posit one understudied reason is that clean air is an experience good, whose value is revealed after consumption. We test this using a cluster-randomized trial, and seek to document an “experience wedge”, i.e. a difference between anticipated and realized utility of consuming a good. We deploy a novel experience-based intervention, installing air monitors and purifiers, potentially a more salient treatment than traditional information in pamphlets or videos. To explore the mechanisms behind the hypothesized wedge, we implement a purifier-only treatment to distinguish between (1) knowledge about objective pollution exposure and (2) the sensory experience of breathing in clean air. This will be the first experimental evidence demonstrating how experience can shift demand for clean air, with implications for public health policy, environmental awareness campaigns, and using WTP estimates in economic evaluations.

    Air pollution within African cities is high but unevenly distributed. In principle, individuals could mitigate the severe health risk by working in the less polluted parts of the city. In practice, we show that pollution avoidance is challenging because firms locate on the busiest and most polluted roads searching for customer visibility. Both workers and entrepreneurs bear the cost of this pollution exposure, but the benefits are unequally distributed: profits are much higher in polluted areas, while compensating differentials in wages are minimal. An information experiment reveals limited awareness of pollution, suggesting that workers might be undercompensated for their exposure.

    This study investigates the relationship between outdoor and indoor air pollution in Jakarta, Indonesia, one of the largest cities in the world. Using data from over 300 indoor and outdoor pollution monitors over a three-month period, we explore the temporal and spatial relationship between outdoor and indoor PM2.5 concentrations. Our key findings reveal that penetration rates of outdoor pollution into indoor spaces are significantly higher than those documented in previous studies conducted in developed settings. We quantify the proportion of indoor air pollution attributable to outdoor sources versus indoor sources, providing insights into the primary drivers of indoor air quality. Through extensive surveying, we also explore factors contributing to heterogeneity in the outdoor-indoor pollution relationship, including housing structure, demographic variables, and household behavior. Our findings underscore the importance of considering both outdoor and indoor air quality in comprehensive pollution mitigation strategies.

#### Disinvestment in Transportation Infrastructures, the Case of France

<div id="jobs-abstract4" style="display: none; margin-top: 10px;">
    Transportation infrastructure determines a location's accessibility and, in turn, is a key driver of demographic and economic distributions across space. Investments and dis-investments in this infrastructure are common, but the impacts of contractionary transportation policies have not been extensively studied. Using a simple modification of the standard quantitative spatial model, I theorize that while positive accessibility changes to a location result in rapid population adjustment, negative changes may create a slow and asymmetric population adjustment due to the presence of slowly depreciating housing capital. This paper provides empirical support for the existence of these non-linear responses by studying the impact of the closure of more than one half of the French railroad between 1930 and 1960. I find that, within a given county, municipalities hit one-standard deviation harder by the policy had a 7 percent lower population growth between 1926 and 1982. This response is slow, strongest between two and four decades after the policy, and is non-linear in the short run: it is systematically lower when estimated on market access decrease than it is for (relative) market access increase.
